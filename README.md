# DeviceInfoTest

This is a test app created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and [`react-native-device-info`](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage) to confirm that React Native Device Info works on Fire OS devices.

Note that Battery Listener is not supported on Fire OS tablets and must be removed to make the library work.
